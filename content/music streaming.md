So, hear me out, what if we combined the worst parts of each of the above methods? All the organizational and financial issues of local media, with added maintenance costsðŸ™ƒ All jokes aside self hosting a music server isn't for anyone, but if you're interested in owning your media and learning about server hosting this project may be for you! If you're looking for an in depth guide to setting up a linux server, check out [Hardware Haven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIHiRW4QH6I) on youtube. The [Jellyfin docs](https://jellyfin.org/docs/) are another great resource.
