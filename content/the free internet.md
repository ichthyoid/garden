The number of free services available online is, frankly, ridiculous.
What's this? You want to post text blogs? Free! You want to share endless pictures? Free! You want to upload a four hour long videos? Three times a day??? Well guess what!

This sounds great! No problem, post overðŸ˜¸ Ok perhaps I lied. The first step is to remember that the internet is a physical thing. This endless data is stored in huge datacenters, spending enormous amounts of power, space, labor, and computer components. The cloud isn't some amorphous other, it's right here

How could this be possible??? I ask rhetorically, the answer is as it has always been: ads! And of more concern, vacuuming up as much data about you as physically possible.
Unfortunate then that my brain hates the idea of paying for

search, email
